Hi, there :wave:

Thanks for stopping by to check out our project! :tada:

## About
Welcome to our final project repository for CS573 Data Visualization course at WPI (Spring 2024). Here, we embark on a journey to make learning data visualization a fun and engaging experience for kids, intertwinning it with enchanting world of animals.

#### Mission
Our mission is to provide a playful platform for kids to explore the realm of data visualization while discovering fascinating facts about animals. We've crafted interactive charts within our website for kids to interact with, alongside creating delightful educational videos.

#### Vision
We're continuously refining and expanding this project even after the course, and we'd love to hear your thoughts and suggestions! If you have any ideas or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to any of us. :eyes:
